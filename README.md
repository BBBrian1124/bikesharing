# Overview of the analysis:
* We have been given data for Citibike (a bike rental service) which include the trip's details such as: start/end locations, duration and the rider's information such as: gender, birth year and customer type. We will analyze this information to see if we can obtain insight into whether or not we would be able to implement a service similar to citibikes in our city.

# Summary: 
* Based on the analysis seen in the Tableau story, it seems that the popularity of bike services is to travel to and from work. 
* We have observed that the peak times are around 8 AM to 9 AM and 5 PM to 7 PM on weekdays which is right around opening and closing business hours. 
* The majority of our riders are male subscribers aged 40 to 45 which would be the age group for working adults. Additionally, the fact that majority of users are subscribers, suggests that they are repeat customers whom may be using the services for the same reason (i.e. daily commutes to work). 
* With this in mind, in comparing the cities where this service is popular with our city, we need to consider: is there a need to use bikes to commute to work (i.e. competitors and substitutes) and do we have enough of a 'target audience' (i.e. working males whom wish to bike to work) to have a customer base for this service. 
* 2 additional visualizations we can create are: (1) gender/age breakdown by start/end location so we can see if all popular cities also have the same 'target demographic' of working male adults and (2) perhaps to add a calculated field for trip length so that it can potentially provide insights into why the users/riders are using bikes as opposed to other forms of transportation.
